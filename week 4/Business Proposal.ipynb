    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods in North York, Toranto.\n",

Facts to keep in mind includes the ease of access to Cafes, Schools, Super markets, medical centers, grocery shops, malls, theatres, hospital,etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Which Tried to Solve:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Sorted list of house in terms of housing prices in a ascending or descending order\n",

    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work Flow:\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering Approach:\n",
    "I will be clustering the data using a form of unsupervised machine learning known as k-means clustering algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries used Project:\n",
    "Pandas: Dataframe creation and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
